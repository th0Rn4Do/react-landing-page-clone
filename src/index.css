/*
The reason I add the code below (*, ::before..), is I want to be sure that whenever I style the elements on the website, I know wether I put a padding, margin or border exactly how the element will be considered related to the padding, margin, border. Check out: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-box-model-explained-with-examples/ and inspect the element with dev tools to see it more clearly

By adding the font-family in curly brackets after all the h1 - h6 in index.css, I'm applying it to all the headings we're going to use in this project.
Alternatively I would not add the part below (h1 - h6 {font-fam...) but then I would have to change every heading manually.
